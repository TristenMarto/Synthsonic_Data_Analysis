\lhead{\emph{Results}}

This chapter talks about the results from the experiment with different SMOTE variants. 

10 oversamplers, including Synthsonic, were used in classifying 27 imbalanced datasets. Table X shows the information of the datasets, all datasets have an imbalance ratio of at least 1:10

\section{Numerical datasets}
The first subcategory of datasets are the ones with either only numerical features or a majority of them. Regular SMOTE techniques are expected to perform better here as their techniques require continuous features to work.

Figure~\ref{fig:bar_numerical} shows the
