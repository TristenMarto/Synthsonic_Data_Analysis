\section{SMOTE basics}

Describe how SMOTE works: Point selection and linear combination algorithm.

\section{oversampling techniques}
This section will talk about oversampling in general and will take a closer look at specific oversamplers.

Dealing with imbalanced data can be done in different ways, there are undersampling techniques where you remove samples from the majority class. This has the drawback that important data may be removed. The main focus point of this thesis are oversampling techniques, where different methods are used in order to synthesize new samples for the minority class. Both methods have a similar end goal: make the dataset more balanced.
