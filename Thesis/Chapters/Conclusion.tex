\lhead{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item standard XGBoost already performs well on imbalanced datasets.
        \item Synthsonic has higher runtimes than other oversamplers, the extra time is not always worth it.
        \item Synthsonic scores higher on categorical datasets, likely due to the fact it uses a Bayesian network to model all features instead of categorical only.
        \item overall, the effect of oversampling in general seems to be minimal. There is always an improvement, but very small in absolute numbers.
    \end{itemize}
