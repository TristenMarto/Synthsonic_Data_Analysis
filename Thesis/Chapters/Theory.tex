\subsection{Synthsonic}

Synthsonic consists out of multiple reversible transformations of features. It can handle both numerical and categorical features, and will split a dataset $X$ into a numerical and categorical set, so that $X = (X_{num}, X_{cat})$. Modeling of the dataset happens in five steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Numerical features are transformed into uniformly distributed ones, using invertible steps, from which the first-order correlations have been removed.
    \item Categorical and discretized numerical features are jointly modeled with a Bayesian network.
    \item Specific features can be selected for additional modeling.
    \item A discriminative learner is trained to model the residual discrepancies observed between the input data and the Bayesian network.
    \item The discriminative learner is calibrated to reweight synthetic data from the Bayesian network.
\end{enumerate}
